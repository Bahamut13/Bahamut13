### Hello, My name is Colyn Reed. I am a graduate of Full Sail University with a Bachelor's degree in Game Development.
I look forward to bringing an incredible enthusiasm and work ethic to the gaming industry. 
In my free time I enjoy playing games of all genres, but my favorite are RPG's like Baldurs Gate.

I currently live in Winter Park, FL.
